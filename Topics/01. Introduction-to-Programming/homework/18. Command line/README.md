# Command line

## Description
**The following task is not hard, but will require a bit of research on your part.** Open up a terminal/command line in a folder of your choice. You have to do the following tasks using the terminal:
- Make the terminal list the files and directories in the current directory by using the `dir` command
- Change your directory to one of the folders with the `cd` command
- List the files/folders again with `dir`
- Go back to the initial directory you started from with `cd ..`
- Create a folder using the `mkdir` command(name it whatever you like)
- Change the current directory of the terminal to the new folder with the `cd` command
- Create an empty file named **HelloCmd.cs**
- Open the file using the terminal
    - You can either type **HelloCmd.cs** to open the file with it's default program
    - Or you can open it with notepad with the command `notepad HelloCmd.cs`
- Write some C# in the file, save it and close it
- Use the `type` command to print the contents of the **HelloCmd.cs** file you just created to the terminal
- Research how to resize your terminal, how to change the colors, how to change the font style and size. Set them to whatever you prefer.

## Notes
- If you're not running Windows, some of the commands will not be available in the terminal.
    - Use `ls` instead of `dir`
    - Use `touch` for file creation
    - Use `less` or `more` instead of `type`

## Submission
- You do not have to submit anything for this problem.
